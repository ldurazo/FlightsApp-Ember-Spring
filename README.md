=====================

Nearsoft academy project for talent incubator of Luis Durazo

`mvn tomcat7:run` should open the server at `localhost:8080/mvn-webapp-flights`

To open the webapp, open `index.html` in `/client-side-ember` as is

Other dependencies are:
install postgres, then follow details in file DatabaseQueriesInfo

install ruby, then install the gems in airportsScript.rb and run with `$ ruby airportsScript.rb` but this may take a while
since it will fill the database with an aprox. 15 thousand airports information.
